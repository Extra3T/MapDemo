# MapDemo

An example of taking raw geo data and turning it into an interactive Leaflet.js based map served over static web pages.

This repository comes without the `geodata.json` file in place. A ready made version of it is available in `readymade-geodata.json` - rename it to `geodata.json` if you wish to run the map example without following the article.

Full article with details: To be published soon.
